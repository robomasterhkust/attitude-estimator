# Calibration examples for Inertia Measurement Unit  (IMU)
Closed-form Inertia Measurement Unit calibration process by six side calibration.
The example is based on a microprocessor called ESP32, designed for six IMU mounted for Cubli Project, but the core calibration is there.
The original calibration process can be found in https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/src/modules/commander/accelerometer_calibration.cpp
